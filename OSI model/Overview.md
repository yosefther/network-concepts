## Introduction
# Overview of the OSI Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model** is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven distinct layers. It helps standardize network communication and troubleshooting.

## OSI Model Layers

1. **Physical Layer**  
   - Deals with raw data transmission (bits) over physical media.
   - Examples: Cables, switches, radio signals.

2. **Data Link Layer**  
   - Ensures reliable data transfer between adjacent network nodes.
   - Examples: MAC addresses, Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11).

3. **Network Layer**  
   - Handles data routing between different networks.
   - Examples: IP, ICMP, routers.

4. **Transport Layer**  
   - Provides end-to-end communication and error handling.
   - Examples: TCP, UDP.

5. **Session Layer**  
   - Manages and maintains communication sessions.
   - Examples: RPC, NetBIOS.

6. **Presentation Layer**  
   - Translates, encrypts, and compresses data.
   - Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII.

7. **Application Layer**  
   - Interfaces with end-user applications.
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

## Why the OSI Model Matters

- Helps understand how different networking protocols interact.
- Assists in troubleshooting by isolating issues at specific layers.
- Provides a universal standard for networking communication.
