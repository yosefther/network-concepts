# VPN Protocols Explained

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** protocol defines the rules and standards used to establish and maintain a secure and encrypted connection between your device and a VPN server. Different protocols offer different balances between **speed**, **security**, and **stability**.

## üéØ Benefits of VPNs

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Connects remote networks** | For example, a business with multiple offices can use a VPN to access internal resources (e.g., servers, files) from another location securely. |
| **Offers privacy** | VPNs encrypt traffic so only the sender and recipient can understand the data. This is especially useful when using public Wi-Fi networks. |
| **Offers anonymity** | VPNs can hide user traffic from ISPs and governments. Activists and journalists often use VPNs in countries with restricted freedom of speech. However, the anonymity depends on whether the VPN provider logs data. |

## üì¶ Common VPN Protocols

### 1. OpenVPN
- **Type**: Open-source  
- **Encryption**: Up to AES-256  
- **Port**: UDP (default) or TCP  
- **Pros**:
  - Highly secure and configurable  
  - Open-source and regularly audited  
- **Cons**:
  - Requires third-party software  
  - May be slower on older hardware

### 2. WireGuard
- **Type**: Open-source  
- **Encryption**: ChaCha20  
- **Port**: UDP (default port 51820)  
- **Pros**:
  - Very fast and lightweight  
  - Easier to audit (small codebase)  
- **Cons**:
  - Still relatively new  
  - Limited support in some routers

### 3. IKEv2/IPSec
- **Type**: Closed-source (typically)  
- **Encryption**: AES-256 with IPSec  
- **Port**: UDP 500, 4500  
- **Pros**:
  - Very stable, especially on mobile networks  
  - Fast reconnection when switching networks  
- **Cons**:
  - Limited open-source implementations  
  - Can be blocked by some firewalls

### 4. L2TP/IPSec
- **Type**: Built-in support on most systems  
- **Encryption**: AES (via IPSec)  
- **Port**: UDP 1701, 500, 4500  
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to set up  
  - Widely supported  
- **Cons**:
  - Slower due to double encapsulation  
  - May be blocked by NAT/firewalls  

---

### 5. PPTP (Obsolete)
- **Type**: Very old  
- **Encryption**: Weak (MPPE)  
- **Port**: TCP 1723  
- **Pros**:
  - Extremely fast  
  - Built-in on almost all platforms  
- **Cons**:
  - Insecure and deprecated  
  - Easily blocked or intercepted

## üß™ VPN Technologies Overview

| VPN Technology | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **PPP** | Used by PPTP to provide authentication and data encryption. Requires private key and certificate to match for a successful connection. Not routable by itself. |
| **PPTP** | Uses PPP for encryption and allows traffic to leave the network. Easy to set up and widely supported, but weak encryption. |
| **IPSec** | Uses the standard IP framework to encrypt data. More secure but complex to configure. Supported by many modern systems. |

## üõ°Ô∏è Choosing the Right Protocol

- **For security**: OpenVPN or WireGuard  
- **For speed**: WireGuard or IKEv2/IPSec  
- **For mobile**: IKEv2/IPSec for seamless switching  
- **Avoid**: PPTP due to weak encryption and known vulnerabilities
