# Switch in Networking

## What is a Switch?
A **network switch** is a device that connects devices within a local area network (LAN) and efficiently directs data packets to their intended destinations. Unlike hubs, switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model and use MAC addresses to forward data.

## How a Switch Works
1. **MAC Address Learning**: The switch learns the MAC addresses of connected devices by examining incoming frames.
2. **Forwarding & Filtering**: The switch forwards frames only to the appropriate port based on the destination MAC address.
3. **Loop Prevention**: Managed switches use Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops.

## Types of Switches
- **Unmanaged Switch**: A plug-and-play device with no configuration options.
- **Managed Switch**: Allows customization and network management features (VLANs, QoS, SNMP, etc.).
- **Layer 2 Switch**: Operates based on MAC addresses.
- **Layer 3 Switch**: Has routing capabilities and operates using IP addresses.

## Advantages of Using a Switch
- **Improves Network Efficiency**: Reduces collision domains and enhances bandwidth utilization.
- **Enhances Security**: Can segment networks using VLANs.
- **Supports High-Speed Communication**: Enables full-duplex transmission for faster data transfer.

## Common Switch Features
- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)**: Segregates network traffic.
- **Port Mirroring**: Used for network monitoring.
- **Link Aggregation**: Combines multiple links for increased bandwidth.
- **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Provides power to connected devices like IP cameras and phones.
