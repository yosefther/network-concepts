# Transport Layer

## Overview
The **Transport Layer** is the fourth layer in the OSI model, responsible for end-to-end communication, error detection, and data flow control between applications on different devices.

## Responsibilities
1. **Segmentation and Reassembly**
   - Breaks large messages into smaller segments for transmission.
   - Reassembles segments at the destination.

2. **Reliable and Unreliable Transmission**
   - Ensures reliable delivery using acknowledgments and retransmissions (TCP).
   - Provides fast, connectionless communication (UDP).

3. **Flow Control**
   - Manages data transmission speed to prevent overwhelming the receiver.
   - Uses mechanisms like sliding window protocol.

4. **Error Detection and Correction**
   - Detects and retransmits lost or corrupted data.
   - Uses checksums for error checking.

## Key Protocols
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: Provides fast, connectionless communication.
- **Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)**: Combines features of TCP and UDP for specialized applications.

## Transport Layer Mechanisms
- **Multiplexing and Demultiplexing**: Allows multiple applications to use the network simultaneously.
- **Connection Establishment and Termination**: Uses a three-way handshake (TCP) to establish reliable connections.
- **Congestion Control**: Adjusts transmission rate to prevent network congestion.

## TCP vs. UDP Comparison
| Feature         | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | UDP (User Datagram Protocol) |
|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Connection Type | Connection-oriented            | Connectionless            |
| Reliability     | Ensures reliable delivery      | No guarantee of delivery  |
| Speed          | Slower due to acknowledgments  | Faster due to minimal overhead |
| Use Cases      | Web browsing, email, file transfer | Streaming, gaming, VoIP |

## Summary
The Transport Layer ensures data is delivered efficiently and correctly between applications. It provides both reliable (TCP) and fast, connectionless (UDP) communication, depending on application needs.
